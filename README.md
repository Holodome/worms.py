# worms.py

My free interpretation of worms game.
This is a tactical physics-based game 
where teams of worms try to eliminate each other using different artillery.

## Notes

I started doing this project in C++ using SDL2 
but soon I realized that I have known python for a time,
 and still have not done anything big in it.
 So I decided to stick with python and check if it capable of doing something quite complex.
